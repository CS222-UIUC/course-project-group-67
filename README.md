(a) Summary of presentation introduction 

Our project is called Netflix WRAPPED. There are over 223 million Netflix users in the world and each user spends a little 3.23 hours per day on average. As the end of the year is coming around, finding out one's stats in relation to viewing history for Netflix would be interesting to see visually. From total minutes watched to top shows/tv shows, our project uses data pulled from the Netflix API, third party tools, and personal curated data to provide a cohesive report of what their past year has been like.
