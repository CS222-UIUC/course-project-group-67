(a) Summary of presentation introduction 

Our project is called Netflix WRAPPED. There are over 223 million Netflix users in the world and each user spends a little 3.23 hours per day on average. As the end of the year is coming around, finding out one's stats in relation to viewing history for Netflix would be interesting to see visually. From total minutes watched to top movies/tv shows, our project uses data pulled from the Netflix API, third party tools, and personal curated data to provide a cohesive report of what their past year has been like. The report is then displayed back to the user as a chart where the user can see how much time they spent on Netflix and the breakdown of how they spent that time. 

(b) Describes technical architecture 

Netflix WRAPPED consists of various components such as the frontend, backend, and database. It asks the user to input their viewing history csv file, based on that it comes up with visual statistics. Using the database to identify common shows, other viewers that had similar viewing history were recommended the same shows to the user. 

(c) Provides reproducible installation instructions 

To produce installation of the program, all the user needs to do is clone the github and run the application, with the attached Netflix CSV as the input. The application will take the CSV, parse it, analyze it, and create charts for the user to visualize how they've been spending their time on Netflix.
