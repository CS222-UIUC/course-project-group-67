(a) Summary of presentation introduction 

Our project is called Netflix WRAPPED. There are over 223 million Netflix users in the world and each user spends a little 3.23 hours per day on average. As the end of the year is coming around, finding out one's stats in relation to viewing history for Netflix would be interesting to see visually. From total minutes watched to top shows/tv shows, our project uses data pulled from the Netflix API, third party tools, and personal curated data to provide a cohesive report of what their past year has been like.

(b) Describes technical architecture 

Netflix WRAPPED consists of various components such as the frontend, backend, and database. It asks the user to input their viewing history csv file, based on that it comes up with visual statistics. Using the database to identify common shows other viewers that had similar viewing history watched to recommend them to the user.
